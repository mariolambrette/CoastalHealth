## Installation

You can install the development version of the Coastal Health Data Explorer in R/RStudio like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

devtools::install_github("mariolambrette/CoastalHealth", build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

## Run

You can launch the application by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(CoastalHealth)
run_app()
```

## Instructions

1. After running `run_app()` the Data Explorer will launch in a new tab in your browser
2. You will be presented with a map of England and Wales.
3. You can use the button in the top left corner of the screen to select one or more Environment Agency (EA) management catchment areas of interest.
4. The outline of the selected management catchments will be shown to you and you can optionally use the sidebar to also render the rivers, lakes, waterbody outlines and the relevant marine area on the map.
5. You can use the 'Select Data Layers' tab in the sidebar to select data layers that you are interested in by navigating the menu and highlighting layers of interest.
6. Some layers contain temporal data. You can use the date range selection in the sidebar to select a time period of interest. Where possible, data will be filtered to this time period.
7. Once you are happy with your selection you can click the confirm button and you will be shown a table containing all the selected layers.
8. You can use the available buttons/hyperlinks to (1) navigate to the data layer's home webpage, (2) load the layer into your active R session, (3) download the layer directly to your computer, (4) perform the above actions in bulk for all selected layers and/or (5) download the table of layer names and urls.
9. When you have finished you can close the app and return to your R session by either (1) closing the browser tab running the app or (2) pressing the 'Quit' button in the top left of the screen. If the app crashes or closes in some other way, you can still relaunch it but may find some odd behaviour on start up. If this happens, close the app 'properly' and relaunch it.

Where possible (i.e. where the data provider allows) data will be spatially cropped to the management catchment area(s) and time period selected.
